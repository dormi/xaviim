    <h3>How to include all files in a folder in .gitignore except a few</h3>
    I was wondering how to do this, when I saw that the <code>.gitignore</code>
    file autogenerated by Rails already does it: 
    <%= snippet 'gitignore_all_files_in_folder_except_one', language: 'yaml' %>
    With that we are ignoring all files in the <code>log</code> folder except the 
    <code>.keep</code> file.

    <h3>A better way to loop from a number to a lower number in Ruby</h3>
    I wanted to iterate from a higher number (<code>hi</code>) to a lower number 
    (<code>lo</code>), passing a block.<br>
    First I tried:
    <%= snippet 'ruby_countdown_wrong.rb' %>
    But then I noticed the 
    <%= link_to 'downto', 'https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Integer.html#method-i-downto', target: '_blank' %>
    method:
    <%= snippet 'ruby_countdown_correct.rb' %>
    ðŸ™‚<br>
    Of course, there is also the related 
    <%= link_to 'upto', 'https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Integer.html#method-i-upto', target: '_blank' %>
    method.

    <h3>A fast way to check if Rails ActionMailer is sending emails</h3>
    To check if our mail sending configuration in Rails is configured properly, just fire up
    a Rails console and paste the following snippet:
    <%= snippet 'rails_actionmailer_send.rb' %>
